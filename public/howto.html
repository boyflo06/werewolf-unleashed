                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>Gather a group of players, ideally 6 or more. The game works best with larger groups.<br>Open the Werewolf app on each player's device and have them join the game using a unique username.<br>In the app, select the number of players and choose the roles you'd like to include in the game, such as Werewolves, Villagers, Seer, Doctor, etc. The app will automatically assign the roles to the players.<br>Once everyone has received their roles, the game can begin.</p>
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>The game consists of two alternating phases: Day and Night.</p>
                <h4>Day Phase :</h4>
                <p>During the day phase, players can openly discuss the events of the night, share information, and try to figure out who the Werewolves are.<br>Players should use the app to keep track of the game progress, such as eliminated players and revealed roles.<br>After some discussion, players will vote to eliminate one player, whom they suspect to be a Werewolf. The player with the most votes will be removed from the game.<br>The app will update the game progress, and the next night phase will begin.</p>
                <h4>Night Phase :</h4>
                <p>During the night phase, all players should close their eyes.<br>The app will use sound cues, and visual cues to notify each role when it's their turn to perform an action.<br>Players should discreetly glance at their screens when they receive a cue and perform their action if it's their turn.<br>When all roles have completed their actions, the app will signal the beginning of the day phase.</p>
                <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>The game continues with alternating night and day phases until one of the following conditions is met:<br>All Werewolves are eliminated - the Villagers win.<br>The number of Werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining Villagers - the Werewolves win.<br>A certain role fills their condition (be the last one alive for example) - they win.</p>
                <p>An explication of all the roles can be found while creating a game by pressign on the <img src="./assets/info-circle.svg" class="small-icon"> button.</p>
